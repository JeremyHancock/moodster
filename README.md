# Moodster
## A Mobile App for Mood Tracking and Visualization

Moodster is a full-stack web application. Users sign up for a unique account, and the app renders visuals of their mood, sleep and diet data using Google Charts. Using the Twilio Programmable SMS API and node-cron node.js task scheduler package, Moodster can also send text alerts to users reminding them to log in and make an entry.

Check it out on [Heroku!](https://moodster.herokuapp.com)
